# OS Compatability and Requirements

## OS Compatability

This is only available for MacOS currently, because of the chromedriver binary.
I have no immediate plans of making it available for linux (and definitely not) for windows.

## Requirements

You must have python 3 installed. 
This was developed using python 3.7.4, so there may be problems on older versions. 
Feel free to raise an issue if you find one.

### Installing python

 - Go to python.org
 - Download the latest python version for your OS
 - Follow the installation process after opening the DMG

*If you have [Homebrew](brew.sh) installed, use the command:*
```brew install python```
